# Project 1
## CPSC 535 - Advanced Algorithms

The python script for each algorithm is named according to the algorithm it implements:  
- `alg1.py` contains the script for baseline and optimized versions of Task A & Task B
- `alg2.py` contains the script for algorithm 2
- `alg3.py` contains the script for algorithm 3

To execute any script, run `python <script name>` in the command line or pass the script path to the python interpreter.

All scripts wrote and tested in Python 3.12 and should work in any Python version >3.9.

All scripts done by Anirudh Ramakrishnan (anirudh.r@csu.fullerton.edu) for Project 1 of CPSC 535
